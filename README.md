## Coding Questions for Platform Engineers

**General Coding and Programming Challenges**

- Write a function to detect deadlocks in a multi-threaded application[3].
- Create an algorithm to efficiently schedule tasks in a distributed system[3].
- Solve a real-world coding challenge using Python or Java, such as parsing logs or automating a repetitive infrastructure task[3][1].
- Implement a script to automate the deployment of a containerized application using Docker and Kubernetes[6].
- Write a program that monitors system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) and triggers alerts when thresholds are exceeded[3].

**System Design and Infrastructure**

- Design a load balancer for a large-scale web application. Explain your approach and considerations for scaling and fault tolerance[3][4].
- Explain how you would implement a distributed logging system that aggregates logs from multiple services and supports querying and alerting[3].
- How would you design a URL shortening service like Bit.ly? Focus on scalability, reliability, and database schema[4].
- Design a system to handle millions of concurrent requests, discussing load balancing, caching, and database scaling strategies[4].

**Automation and CI/CD**

- Write a script to optimize a CI/CD pipeline for faster deployment, for example by parallelizing test execution or caching build artifacts[3].
- Implement infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for provisioning a cloud environment using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation[3].
- Write an automation script (in Bash or Python) to rotate secrets and update them across all dependent services[2][6].

**API and Integration**

- Develop a REST API endpoint that integrates with a third-party service and handles retries and error logging robustly[1][6].
- Write code to connect multiple monitoring tools via their APIs and aggregate metrics into a central dashboard[1].

**Debugging and Code Quality**

- Given a codebase with performance issues, describe and implement steps to identify and resolve bottlenecks (e.g., using profiling tools, optimizing queries, or refactoring code)[6].
- Write a function to parse and validate configuration files (YAML, JSON) and report errors with meaningful messages[6].

**Language and Tooling**

- Demonstrate proficiency in at least one scripting language (Python, Bash, PowerShell) by solving a task such as log file analysis or service orchestration[2][6].
- Write a script that provisions and tears down cloud resources (VMs, storage, networking) using a cloud providerâ€™s SDK or CLI[6].

## Additional Common Coding Questions

- How to print duplicate characters from a string?[5]
- How to check if two strings are anagrams of each other?[5]
- How to print the first non-repeated character from a string?[5]
- How to reverse a given string using recursion?[5]

These questions are tailored to test the practical coding, automation, and system design skills essential for platform engineers, with a focus on real-world scenarios involving infrastructure, distributed systems, and DevOps tooling[1][2][3][6].
