## Coding Questions for Platform Engineers

**General Coding and Programming Challenges**

- Write a function to detect deadlocks in a multi-threaded application.
- Create an algorithm to efficiently schedule tasks in a distributed system.
- Solve a real-world coding challenge using Python or Java, such as parsing logs or automating a repetitive infrastructure task.
- Implement a script to automate the deployment of a containerized application using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Write a program that monitors system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) and triggers alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

**System Design and Infrastructure**

- Design a load balancer for a large-scale web application. Explain your approach and considerations for scaling and fault tolerance.
- Explain how you would implement a distributed logging system that aggregates logs from multiple services and supports querying and alerting.
- How would you design a URL shortening service like Bit.ly? Focus on scalability, reliability, and database schema.
- Design a system to handle millions of concurrent requests, discussing load balancing, caching, and database scaling strategies.

**Automation and CI/CD**

- Write a script to optimize a CI/CD pipeline for faster deployment, for example by parallelizing test execution or caching build artifacts.
- Implement infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for provisioning a cloud environment using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
- Write an automation script (in Bash or Python) to rotate secrets and update them across all dependent services.

**API and Integration**

- Develop a REST API endpoint that integrates with a third-party service and handles retries and error logging robustly.
- Write code to connect multiple monitoring tools via their APIs and aggregate metrics into a central dashboard.

**Debugging and Code Quality**

- Given a codebase with performance issues, describe and implement steps to identify and resolve bottlenecks (e.g., using profiling tools, optimizing queries, or refactoring code).
- Write a function to parse and validate configuration files (YAML, JSON) and report errors with meaningful messages.

**Language and Tooling**

- Demonstrate proficiency in at least one scripting language (Python, Bash, PowerShell) by solving a task such as log file analysis or service orchestration.
- Write a script that provisions and tears down cloud resources (VMs, storage, networking) using a cloud providerâ€™s SDK or CLI.
